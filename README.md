# gitorial-sdk

Gitorial is a framework for building step by step, interactive tutorials using GIT history.

The first example of this framework can be found here: https://github.com/shawntabrizi/rust-state-machine

The framework does not exist today, but here are some ideas for what it should look like:

- [ ] Easily Manage a Gitorial Repo
    - [ ] CLI / UI tooling to easily manage and scaffold compliant git history
    - [ ] CLI / UI tooling for managing individual steps in the tutorial
    - [ ] CI pipelines to check for Gitorial format compliance
    - [ ] CI pipelines to manage a secondary history branch for the Gitorial
        - [ ] Tools to revert a Gitorial to a previous point in history
- [ ] Easily Deploy Gitorials to Popular Documentation Frameworks
    - [ ] Docusarus
    - [ ] MdBook
    - [ ] Docsify
    - [ ] etc...
- [ ] Specialized Plugins to Enhance Tutorial Experience
    - [ ] Custom Code Editors
    - [ ] Custom Plugins for Referencing and Jumping to Code
    - [ ] Local Code Execution and Tutorial Integration
- [ ] Gitorial Enhancements
    - [ ] Framework for public and private tests
